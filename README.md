# WebPageGrabber
A c# winforms project that downloads and saves a given webpage, and the webpages which are linked from it upto a specified depth.


Write a program that takes a URL as an input, and saves the response of that URL in a file, and then does the same for all the pages linked inside that HTML page.

You need to devise a method for generating unique file names for each URL. It would be best if the downloaded files are organized in a way that mimics the URL structure of the site.

Make sure that all your code is commented and easy to read by someone else.
